This is an **UNOFFICIAL** build of the Turin Pi 2 firmware. Created as a fork of the Turing Pi 2 firmware that can be found [here](https://github.com/wenyi0421/turing-pi). The aim for this project is to add most wanted functionalities before the new official firmware is being created.

Even if it's generally safe to use this firmware, I must mention that the you are using it on your own risk. Neither © TURING MACHINES INC. is not responsible for any possible damage made by this firmware.

# Installing the firmware

The easiest way to install the firmware is to download the `swu` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/turing-pi2-community-firmware/releases) and upgrade it through the web panel:

In general, the upgrade process is the same as with the original fimrmware and the more detailed instructions can be found in the [Turing Pi documentation](https://help.turingpi.com/hc/en-us/articles/8686945524893-Baseboard-Management-Controller-BMC-).

# Compiling the firmware

You can compile the formware on your own and the steps to follow are similar to the steps to compile the original firmware.

## Install the necessary dependent packages



```makefile
sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip lib32z1 lib32z1-dev lib32stdc++6 libstdc++6 libncurses-dev u-boot-tools mkbootimg -y
```

## build
